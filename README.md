## 📅 Week 1 - Finding the Missing Eighth Vertex

**Task summary:**  
Determine the missing (eighth) vertex of a 3D box (parallelepiped) using the known visible vertices and their corresponding vanishing points.  
The goal is to reconstruct the correct position of the final vertex by applying geometric and projective relationships.

**Included files:**  
- `1.ipynb` - computational solution  
- `box.jpg` - reference image used in the task
